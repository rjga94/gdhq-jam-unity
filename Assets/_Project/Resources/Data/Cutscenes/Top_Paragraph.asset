  text: "This plane has been ravaged by darkness. The Void, craving perfect order,
    seeks to consume all light in the universe. Yet one rebel star, the hypergiant
    Scuith\u2019i, rages against the dying of the light. Rather than accepting its
    fate, it decides to shatter, sending countless shards of pure energy scorching
    through the galaxy. Each shard, when embedded in a planet\u2019s core, has the
    potential to spread, grow, incubate, one day to bloom into a new star. But The
    Void, hot in pursuit, has sent its Twilight Avatars to extinguish each shard.
    There will be resistance. There will be struggle. There may be slaughter. Despite
    it all, could this shard be the one to reach its goal? "
